# Tea Meets Donut (A work in progress!)

Welcome and thanks for visiting my repo! Tea Meets Donut is a backend focused practice project, inspired by the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, and based in Python and the Django Rest Framework. The aim of this project is to sharpen my Django skills by giving administrators and registered users CRUD capabilities for user profiles which are stored in a database. The database is SQLite3, but will be converted to Postgresql once the project is suitable for deployment.
